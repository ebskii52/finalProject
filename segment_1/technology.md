# Technologies Used

## Data Cleaning and Analysis
We will be using Pandas to clean the data and perform exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be conducted using Python. We will be importing the yelp data downloaded from kaggle.com, and converting that dataset, which is in JSON format, into a dataframe.

## Database Storage
Postgres is the database we will be using.

## Machine Learning
Linear Regression, Deep Learning, and Random Forest are the machine learning models we will be using to train and test our data. We will then choose which machine learning model is the best of the 3.

## Dashboard
Tableau is the application we will be using to display our data. We feel that tableau will give the user the most simplest way of looking at which location geographically is best when considering location and type of restaurant to open. It will include comparable data, such as what type of restaurant it is, whether it got a good or a bad rating, and exactly where it is located.
